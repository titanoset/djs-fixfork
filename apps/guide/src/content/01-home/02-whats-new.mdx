## Site

We have moved from VuePress to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)! The source can be found [here](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/main/apps/guide).

## Pages

- Pages have been revamped to account for our new [create-discord-bot](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/main/packages/create-discord-bot) command-line interface.
- Popular topic are now simply "topics" that detail usage of a particular concept of the API.
- Focus is primarily on discord.js, so irrelevant topics have been removed. It may be better to visit the documentation of the package you are using to learn how to use them.
