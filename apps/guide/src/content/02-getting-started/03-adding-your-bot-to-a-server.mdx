# Adding your bot to a server

After you [set up an application](./setting-up-an-application), you'll notice it's not in any servers yet. So, how does that work?

Before you're able to see your bot in a server, you will need to add it by using an invite link.

## Bot invite links

The basic version of one such link looks like this:

<CH.Code lineNumbers={false}>

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123456789012345678&permissions=0&scope=bot
```

</CH.Code>

The structure of the URL is quite simple:

- _`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize`_ is Discord's standard structure for authorizing an OAuth2 application (such as your bot application) for entry to a Discord server.
- _`client_id=...`_ is to specify _which_ application you want to authorize. You'll need to replace this part with your client's id to create a valid invite link.
- _`permissions=...`_ describes the permissions that your bot will request to be granted by default upon joining the server you are adding it to.
- _`scope=bot`_ specifies that you want to add this application as a Discord bot with the ability to create slash commands.

<Alert title="Warning" type="warning">
	If you get an error message saying "Bot requires a code grant", head over to your application's settings and disable
	the "Requires OAuth2 Code Grant" option. You shouldn't enable this option unless you know why you need to.
</Alert>

## Creating and using your invite link

To create an invite link, head back to the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), click on your bot application, and open the OAuth2 page.

In the sidebar, you'll find the URL generator. Select the _`bot`_ option. Once you select the _`bot`_ option, a list of permissions will appear, allowing you to configure the permissions your bot needs.

Grab the link via the "Copy" button and send it in a channel in Discord. Click on the link you just sent which should reveal this:

Choose the server you want to add the bot to and click "Authorize". Congratulations! You've successfully added your bot to your Discord server.

At this point, you should have a Discord bot you created with [create-discord-bot](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/main/packages/create-discord-bot) with your .env file populated and your Discord bot in a server. You are now ready to do what you like.
