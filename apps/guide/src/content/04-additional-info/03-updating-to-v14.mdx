# Updating to v14

## Before you start

v14 requires Node 16.11 or higher to use, so make sure you're up to date. To check your Node.js version, use _`node --version`_ in your terminal or command prompt, and if it's not high enough, update it! There are many resources online to help you with this step based on your host system.

### Various packages are now included in v14

If you previously had _`@discordjs/builders`_, _`@discordjs/formatters`_, _`@discordjs/rest`_, or _`discord-api-types`_ manually installed, it's _highly_ recommended that you uninstall the packages to avoid package version conflicts.

<CH.Code>

```sh npm
npm uninstall @discordjs/builders @discordjs/formatters @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

```sh yarn
yarn remove @discordjs/builders @discordjs/formatters @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm remove @discordjs/builders @discordjs/formatters @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

```sh bun
bun remove @discordjs/builders @discordjs/formatters @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

</CH.Code>

## Breaking Changes

### API version

discord.js v14 makes the switch to Discord API v10!

### Common Breakages

### Enum Values

Any areas that used to accept a _`string`_ or _`number`_ type for an enum parameter will now only accept a _`number`_.

In addition, the old enums exported by discord.js v13 and lower are replaced with new enums from <DiscordAPITypesLink />.

#### New enum differences

Most of the difference between enums from discord.js and discord-api-types can be summarized as so:

1. Enums are singular, i.e., _`ApplicationCommandOptionTypes`_ -> _`ApplicationCommandOptionType`_
2. Enums that are prefixed with _`Message`_ no longer have the _`Message`_ prefix, i.e., _`MessageButtonStyles`_ -> _`ButtonStyle`_
3. Enum values are _`PascalCase`_ rather than `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, i.e., `.CHAT_INPUT` -> `.ChatInput`

<Alert title="Magic Numbers Warning" type="danger">
	You might be inclined to a raw _`number`_ (most commonly referred to as [magic
	numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))) instead of enum values. This is highly
	discouraged. Enums provide more readability and are more resistant to changes in the API. Magic numbers can obscure
	the meaning of your code in many ways. Check out this [blog
	post](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2020-02/magic-numbers) if you want more context on as to why they shouldn't be
	used.
</Alert>

#### Common enum breakages

Areas like _`Client`_ initialization, JSON slash commands and JSON message components will likely need to be modified to accommodate these changes:

##### Common Client Initialization Changes

<CH.Code>

```diff
- import { Client, Intents } = from 'discord.js';
+ import { Client, GatewayIntentBits, Partials } = from 'discord.js';

- const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS], partials: ['CHANNEL'] });
+ const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds], partials: [Partials.Channel] });
```

</CH.Code>

##### Common Application Command Data changes

<CH.Code>

```diff
+ import { ApplicationCommandType, ApplicationCommandOptionType } = from 'discord.js';

  const command = {
    name: 'ping',
-   type: 'CHAT_INPUT',
+   type: ApplicationCommandType.ChatInput,
    options: [{
      name: 'option',
      description: 'A sample option',
-     type: 'STRING',
+     type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
    }],
  };
```

</CH.Code>

##### Common Button Data changes

<CH.Code>

```diff
+ import { ButtonStyle } = from 'discord.js';

  const button = {
    label: 'test',
-   style: 'PRIMARY',
+   style: ButtonStyle.Primary,
    customId: '1234'
  }
```

</CH.Code>

### Removal of method-based type guards

#### Channels

Some channel type guard methods that narrowed to one channel type have been removed. Instead compare the _`type`_ property against a <DiscordAPITypesLink type="enum" parent="ChannelType" /> enum member to narrow channels.

<CH.Code>

```diff
- channel.isText();
+ channel.type === ChannelType.GuildText;

- channel.isVoice();
+ channel.type === ChannelType.GuildVoice;

- channel.isDM();
+ channel.type === ChannelType.DM;
```

</CH.Code>

### Builders

Builders are no longer returned by the API like they were previously. For example, you send the API an <DocsLink type="class" parent="EmbedBuilder"/> but you receive an <DocsLink type="class" parent="Embed"/> of the same data. This may affect how your code handles received structures such as components. Refer to [message component changes section](#messagecomponent) for more details.

Added <DocsLink package="builders" type="Function" parent="disableValidators" /> and <DocsLink package="builders" type="Function" parent="enableValidators" /> as top-level exports which disable or enable validation (enabled by default).

### Consolidation of create & edit parameters

Various _`create()`_ and _`edit()`_ methods on managers and objects have had their parameters consolidated. The changes are below:

- <DocsLink type="class" parent="Guild" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ in the _`data`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildChannel" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ in the _`data`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildEmoji" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ in the _`data`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="Role" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ in the _`data`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="Sticker" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ in the _`data`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="ThreadChannel" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ in the _`data`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildChannelManager" symbol="create" brackets /> now takes _`name`_ in the _`options`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildChannelManager" symbol="createWebhook" brackets /> (and other text-based channels)
  now takes _`channel`_ and _`name`_ in the _`options`_ parameter
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildChannelManager" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`data`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildEmojiManager" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`data`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildManager" symbol="create" brackets /> now takes _`name`_ as a part of _`options`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildMemberManager" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`data`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildMember" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`data`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildStickerManager" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`data`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="RoleManager" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`options`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="Webhook" symbol="edit" brackets /> now takes _`reason`_ as a part of _`options`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildEmojiManager" symbol="create" brackets /> now takes _`attachment`_ and _`name`_ as
  a part of _`options`_
- <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildStickerManager" symbol="create" brackets /> now takes _`file`_, _`name`_, and _`tags`_
  as a part of _`options`_

### Activity

The following properties have been removed as they are not supported by the API:

- _`Activity#id`_
- _`Activity#platform`_
- _`Activity#sessionId`_
- _`Activity#syncId`_

### Application

_`Application#fetchAssets()`_ has been removed as it is no longer supported by the API.

### BitField

- BitField constituents now have a _`BitField`_ suffix to avoid naming conflicts with the enum names:

```diff
- new Permissions();
+ new PermissionsBitField();

- new MessageFlags();
+ new MessageFlagsBitField();

- new ThreadMemberFlags();
+ new ThreadMemberFlagsBitField();

- new UserFlags();
+ new UserFlagsBitField();

- new SystemChannelFlags();
+ new SystemChannelFlagsBitField();

- new ApplicationFlags();
+ new ApplicationFlagsBitField();

- new Intents();
+ new IntentsBitField();

- new ActivityFlags();
+ new ActivityFlagsBitField();
```

- _`#FLAGS`_ has been renamed to _`#Flags`_

### CDN

The methods that return CDN URLs have changed. Here is an example on a `User`:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- const url = user.displayAvatarURL({ dynamic: true, format: "png", size: 1024 });
+ const url = user.displayAvatarURL({ extension: "png", size: 1024 });
```

</CH.Code>

Dynamic URLs use <DocsLink package="rest" type="Interface" parent="ImageURLOptions"/> and static URLs use <DocsLink package="rest" type="Interface" parent="BaseImageURLOptions"/>. Since dynamic URLs are returned by default, this option has been renamed to _`forceStatic`_ which forces the return of a static URL. Additionally, _`format`_ has been renamed to _`extension`_.

### CategoryChannel

<DocsLink type="class" parent="CategoryChannel" symbol="children" /> is no longer a _`Collection`_ of channels the category
contains. It is now a <DocsLink type="class" parent="CategoryChannelChildManager" />. This also means
_`CategoryChannel#createChannel()`_ has been moved to the <DocsLink type="class" parent="CategoryChannelChildManager" />.

### Channel

The following type guards have been removed:

- _`Channel#isText()`_
- _`Channel#isVoice()`_
- _`Channel#isDirectory()`_
- _`Channel#isDM()`_
- _`Channel#isGroupDM()`_
- _`Channel#isCategory()`_
- _`Channel#isNews()`_

Refer to [this section](#channels) for more context.

The base channel class is now <DocsLink type="class" parent="BaseChannel"/>.

### Client

The _`restWsBridgeTimeout`_ client option has been removed.

### CommandInteractionOptionResolver

<DocsLink type="class" parent="CommandInteractionOptionResolver" symbol="getMember" brackets /> no longer has a parameter
for _`required`_.[^1]

### Constants

- Many constant objects and key arrays are now top-level exports. For example:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- import { Constants } = from 'discord.js';
- const { Colors } = Constants;
+ import { Colors } = from 'discord.js';
```

</CH.Code>

- The refactored constants structures have _`PascalCase`_ member names as opposed to _`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`_ member names.

- Many of the exported constants structures have been replaced and renamed:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- Opcodes
+ GatewayOpcodes

- WSEvents
+ GatewayDispatchEvents

- WSCodes
+ GatewayCloseCodes

- InviteScopes
+ OAuth2Scopes
```

</CH.Code>

### Events

The _`message`_ and _`interaction`_ events are now removed. Use <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="e-messageCreate"/> and <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="e-interactionCreate"/> instead.

_`Client#applicationCommandCreate`_, _`Client#applicationCommandDelete`_, and _`Client#applicationCommandUpdate`_ have all been removed.[^2]

The <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="e-threadMembersUpdate"/> event now emits the users that were added, the users that were removed, and the thread respectively.

### GuildBanManager

Developers should utilise _`deleteMessageSeconds`_ instead of _`days`_ and _`deleteMessageDays`_:

<CH.Code>

```diff
<GuildBanManager>.create('123456789', {
-  days: 3
-  deleteMessageDays: 3
+  deleteMessageSeconds: 3 * 24 * 60 * 60
});
```

</CH.Code>

_`deleteMessageDays`_ and _`days`_ are both deprecated and will be removed in the future.

### Guild

<DocsLink type="class" parent="Guild" symbol="setRolePositions" brackets /> and <DocsLink
	type="class"
	parent="Guild"
	symbol="setChannelPositions"
	brackets
/> have been removed. Use <DocsLink type="class" parent="RoleManager" symbol="setPositions" brackets /> and <DocsLink
	type="class"
	parent="GuildChannelManager"
	symbol="setPositions"
	brackets
/> instead respectively.

<DocsLink type="class" parent="Guild" symbol="maximumPresences" /> no longer has a default value of 25,000.

_`Guild#me`_ has been moved to <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildMemberManager" symbol="me" />.[^3]

### GuildAuditLogs & GuildAuditLogsEntry

_`GuildAuditLogs.build()`_ has been removed as it has been deemed defunct. There is no alternative.

The following properties & methods have been moved to the <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildAuditLogsEntry" /> class:

- `GuildAuditLogs.Targets`
- `GuildAuditLogs.actionType()`
- `GuildAuditLogs.targetType()`

### GuildMember

<DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildMember" symbol="pending" /> is now nullable to account for partial guild members.[^4]

### IntegrationApplication

_`IntegrationApplication#summary`_ has been removed as it is no longer supported by the API.

### Interaction

Whenever an interaction is replied to and one fetches the reply, it could possibly give an <DiscordAPITypesLink type="interface" parent="APIMessage" /> if the guild was not cached. However, interaction replies now always return a discord.js <DocsLink type="class" parent="Message"/> object with _`fetchReply`_ as _`true`_.

The base interaction class is now <DocsLink type="class" parent="BaseInteraction"/>.

### Invite

<DocsLink type="class" parent="Invite" symbol="inviter" /> is now a getter and resolves structures from the cache.

### MessageAttachment

- _`MessageAttachment`_ has now been renamed to <DocsLink type="class" parent="AttachmentBuilder" />.

<CH.Code>

```diff
- new MessageAttachment(buffer, 'image.png');
+ new AttachmentBuilder(buffer, { name: 'image.png' });
```

</CH.Code>

### MessageComponent

- MessageComponents have been renamed as well. They no longer have the _`Message`_ prefix, and now have a _`Builder`_ suffix:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- const button = new MessageButton();
+ const button = new ButtonBuilder();

- const selectMenu = new MessageSelectMenu();
+ const selectMenu = new StringSelectMenuBuilder();

- const actionRow = new MessageActionRow();
+ const actionRow = new ActionRowBuilder();

- const textInput = new TextInputComponent();
+ const textInput = new TextInputBuilder();
```

</CH.Code>

- Components received from the API are no longer directly mutable. If you wish to mutate a component from the API, use _`ComponentBuilder#from()`_. For example, if you want to make a button mutable:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- const editedButton = receivedButton.setDisabled(true);

+ import { ButtonBuilder } = from 'discord.js';
+ const editedButton = ButtonBuilder.from(receivedButton).setDisabled(true);
```

</CH.Code>

### MessageManager

The second parameter of <DocsLink type="class" parent="MessageManager" symbol="fetch" brackets /> has been removed. The <DocsLink type="typedef" parent="BaseFetchOptions" /> the second parameter once was is now merged into the first parameter.

<CH.Code>

```diff
- messageManager.fetch('1234567890', { cache: false, force: true });
+ messageManager.fetch({ message: '1234567890', cache: false, force: true });
```

</CH.Code>

### MessageSelectMenu

- _`MessageSelectMenu`_ has been renamed to <DocsLink type="class" parent="StringSelectMenuBuilder" />.

- _`StringSelectMenuBuilder#addOption()`_ has been removed. Use <DocsLink type="class" parent="StringSelectMenuBuilder" symbol="addOptions" brackets /> instead.

### MessageEmbed

- _`MessageEmbed`_ has now been renamed to <DocsLink type="class" parent="EmbedBuilder" />.

- <DocsLink package="builders" type="Class" parent="EmbedBuilder" symbol="setAuthor" brackets /> now accepts a sole <DocsLink
  	package="builders"
  	type="TypeAlias"
  	parent="EmbedAuthorOptions"
  /> object.

- <DocsLink package="builders" type="Class" parent="EmbedBuilder" symbol="setFooter" brackets /> now accepts a sole <DocsLink
  	package="builders"
  	type="TypeAlias"
  	parent="EmbedFooterOptions"
  /> object.

- _`EmbedBuilder#addField()`_ has been removed. Use <DocsLink package="builders" type="Class" parent="EmbedBuilder" symbol="addFields" brackets/> instead.

<CH.Code>

```diff
- new MessageEmbed().addField('Inline field title', 'Some value here', true);

+ new EmbedBuilder().addFields([
+  { name: 'one', value: 'one', inline: true },
+  { name: 'two', value: 'two', inline: true },
+]);
```

</CH.Code>

### Modal

- _`Modal`_ has been renamed <DocsLink type="class" parent="ModalBuilder" />.

<CH.Code>

```diff
- const modal = new Modal();
+ const modal = new ModalBuilder();
```

</CH.Code>

### PartialTypes

The _`PartialTypes`_ string array has been removed. Use the <DocsLink type="typedef" parent="Partials" /> enum instead.

In addition to this, there is now a new partial: _`Partials.ThreadMember`_.

### Permissions

The thread permissions _`USE_PUBLIC_THREADS`_ and _`USE_PRIVATE_THREADS`_ have been removed as they are deprecated in the API. Use _`CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS`_ and _`CREATE_PRIVATE_THREADS`_ respectively.

_`ManageEmojisAndStickers`_ has been deprecated due to API changes. Its replacement is _`ManageGuildExpressions`_.[^7]

### PermissionOverwritesManager

Overwrites are now keyed by the _`PascalCase`_ permission key rather than the _`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`_ permission key.

### REST Events

#### apiRequest

This REST event has been removed as discord.js now uses [Undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) as the underlying request handler. You must now use a [Diagnostics Channel](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/docs/api/DiagnosticsChannel). Here is a simple example:

<CH.Code>

```js JavaScript
import diagnosticsChannel from 'node:diagnostics_channel';

diagnosticsChannel.channel('undici:request:create').subscribe(({ request }) => {
	const { request } = data;
	console.log(request.method); // Log the method
	console.log(request.path); // Log the path
	console.log(request.headers); // Log the headers
	console.log(request); // Or just log everything!
});
```

```ts TypeScript
import diagnosticsChannel from 'node:diagnostics_channel';
import { type DiagnosticsChannel } from 'undici';

diagnosticsChannel.channel('undici:request:create').subscribe((data) => {
	const { request } = data as DiagnosticsChannel.RequestCreateMessage;
	console.log(request.method); // Log the method
	console.log(request.path); // Log the path
	console.log(request.headers); // Log the headers
	console.log(request); // Or just log everything!
});
```

</CH.Code>

You can find further examples at the [Undici Diagnostics Channel documentation](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/docs/api/DiagnosticsChannel).

#### apiResponse

This REST event has been renamed to _`response`_ and moved to <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="rest"/>:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- client.on('apiResponse', ...);
+ client.rest.on('response', ...);
```

</CH.Code>

#### invalidRequestWarning

This REST event has been moved to <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="rest"/>:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- client.on('invalidRequestWarning', ...);
+ client.rest.on('invalidRequestWarning', ...);
```

</CH.Code>

#### rateLimit

This REST event has been renamed to _`rateLimited`_ and moved to <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="rest"/>:

<CH.Code>

```diff
- client.on('rateLimit', ...);
+ client.rest.on('rateLimited', ...);
```

</CH.Code>

### RoleManager

_`Role.comparePositions()`_ has been removed. Use <DocsLink type="class" parent="RoleManager" symbol="comparePositions" brackets/> instead.

### Sticker

<DocsLink type="class" parent="Sticker" symbol="tags" /> is now a nullable string (_`string | null`_). Previously, it was
a nullable array of strings (_`string[] | null`_).[^5]

### ThreadChannel

The _`MAX`_ helper used in _`ThreadAutoArchiveDuration`_ has been removed. Discord has since allowed any guild to use any auto archive time which makes this helper redundant.

### ThreadMemberManager

The second parameter of <DocsLink type="class" parent="ThreadMemberManager" symbol="fetch" brackets /> has been removed. The <DocsLink type="class" parent="BaseFetchOptions" /> the second parameter once was is now merged into the first parameter. In addition, the boolean helper to specify _`cache`_ has been removed.

Usage is now as follows:

<CH.Code>

```diff
  // The second parameter is merged into the first parameter.
- threadMemberManager.fetch('1234567890', { cache: false, force: true });
+ threadMemberManager.fetch({ member: '1234567890', cache: false, force: true });

  // The lone boolean has been removed. One must be explicit here.
- threadMemberManager.fetch(false);
+ threadMemberManager.fetch({ cache: false });
```

</CH.Code>

### Util

_`Util.removeMentions()`_ has been removed. To control mentions, you should use _`allowedMentions`_ on <DocsLink type="typedef" parent="BaseMessageOptions" /> instead.

_`Util.splitMessage()`_ has been removed. This utility method is something the developer themselves should do.

_`Util.resolveAutoArchiveMaxLimit()`_ has been removed. Discord has since allowed any guild to use any auto archive time which makes this method redundant.

Other functions in _`Util`_ have been moved to top-level exports so you can directly import them from discord.js.

<CH.Code>

```diff
- import { Util } from 'discord.js';
- Util.escapeMarkdown(message);

+ import { escapeMarkdown } from 'discord.js';
+ escapeMarkdown(message);
```

</CH.Code>

### .deleted fields have been removed

You can no longer use the _`deleted`_ property to check if a structure was deleted.[^6]

### VoiceChannel

_`VoiceChannel#editable`_ has been removed. You should use <DocsLink type="class" parent="GuildChannel" symbol="manageable"/> instead.

### VoiceRegion

_`VoiceRegion#vip`_ has been removed as it is no longer part of the API.

### Webhook

The second parameter of <DocsLink type="class" parent="Webhook" symbol="fetchMessage" brackets/> no longer allows a boolean to be passed. The _`cache`_ option in <DocsLink type="typedef" parent="WebhookFetchMessageOptions"/> should be used instead.

## Features

Component collector options now use the <DiscordAPITypesLink type="enum" parent="ComponentType" /> enum values:

<CH.Code>

```diff
+ import { ComponentType } from 'discord.js';

  const collector = interaction.channel.createMessageComponentCollector({
	  filter,
-	  componentType: 'BUTTON',
+	  componentType: ComponentType.Button,
	  time: 20000
  });
```

</CH.Code>
